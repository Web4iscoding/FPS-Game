## Graphical Abstract
For this proposed project, a First Person Shooter (FPS) game is built using the Unity Engine.  
The game is a multi-platform First Person Shooter (FPS) game with multiple modes and can guarantee endless hours of replayability. With tutorial mode, the game’s basic mechanics can be thoroughly understood via the easy-to-follow on-screen instructions. The actual game is separated into 2 parts – Normal mode and Battle mode; with normal mode, the player can experience all the scenes independent to each other with a variety of difficulties; with battle mode, the level order is designed in a way to make the mode streamlined with an end after the boss battle.
